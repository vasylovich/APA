This project help Ph.D. students and others to cite medical/biological articles. 
In the draft, people write something like - 'savchyn 2016 modelling adenocarcinoma '
So now you can put it into the site - dmytryk.pp.ua, and you will have the citation (if the article exist in DB)
Generally, the project works with Entrez Programming Utilities (E-utilities) https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/home/develop/api/
Here is only 2 frontend files - index, results, and 1 file with logic - views. dmytryk.pp.ua made with Django, but the Django engine is not uploaded
